    <h2 class="text-2xl">Of Harmonics and Spectra</h2>
    <p>
      Coincident Spectra is an additive synthesizer that generates sounds from
      16 sine wave 'partials' that can be switched between harmonics and
      spectra. Harmonics are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency.
      Spectra remap harmonics so that the partial tones coincide with a selected
      equal temperament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coincident spectra reduce sensory dissonance and beating between the
      timbre and tuning, rendering chords more in tune.

      MIDI is available in Chrome and Chromium-based browsers, and it will
      likely be available in Firefox soon.

    <p>
      The gain sliders control the amplitude of each partial. Adjusting them
      changes the timbre of the instrument.
